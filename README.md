I'm a Software Engineer, who have a very strong visual perception of design, I ❤ simplicity, and white spaces.

I am a developer who takes delight in web accessibility and users' experience starting from the visual (layout, color, and font) to meeting the users' needs (functionality). I ❤ to see the wow 😲 expression on the users' faces.
